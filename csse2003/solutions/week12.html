We'll include a few of the features from the class project. &nbsp;Consider the following features.</div></div><div><ol style="color: rgb(68,68,68);font-family: Geneva , sans-serif;"><li>Identify as many design patterns as you can for the above functionality. What classes (what functionality) would play what role in the pattern?</li><li>Draw a UML Class Diagram of your design.</li></ol><div><font color="#444444"><br></font></div></div><div><font color="#444444"><br></font></div><div><div style="color: rgb(68,68,68);font-family: Geneva , sans-serif;"><ul><li>Robots are controlled by AI routines in a different package than the core of the game. They can also "change driver" -- that is the AI routine can be swapped to a different one in the middle of a battle.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>Robots can be blessed with particular powers through various means (pickups, "kill-streaks", game set-up)</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>A battle can have various victory conditions -- last robot standing, highest score, even first-across-the-finish-line (race on a map)<br></li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>Objects can be placed on the field of battle. These objects can include everything from pick-ups to land-mines.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>Battles can be constructed in various complex ways using any or all the different features</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>All robots in a battle need to be able to query an object that knows about the battle state.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>Robots pass messages to each other via a mediator -- this can for instance enforce the requirement in "team deathmatch" that robots only communicate with other robots on the same team.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>There is a central event system that knows everything that happens in the game (robots firing, bumping into each other, etc) and is responsible for both logging them and passing the events out to relevant listeners.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>One of the listeners to the game is a UI that can graphically depict the game on-screen.</li></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>Also include your team's feature!</li></ul></div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><h2 style="font-family: Geneva , sans-serif;color: rgb(68,68,68);">Once upon a Time &amp; Fall Out</h2></div><div><br></div><div><ul style="color: rgb(68,68,68);font-family: Geneva , sans-serif;"><li>Imagine the Village has gone national, and there are all sorts of systems collecting data about every kind of event you could think of in the country (financial transactions, travel, who you communicate with online, etc.) &nbsp;But it's so big it keeps breaking down. How can the Village technicians track down, fix, and test the failures:</li><ul><li>Suppose a financial system was reporting the value of transactions erroneously. How would you track down the bug, and how would you test you'd fixed it?</li><li>Suppose in peak hour, the train monitoring system keeps crashing. How would you find out what the limiting factor is, and how would you test you'd fixed it?</li></ul></ul><div><br></div><div><br></div><br style="color: rgb(68,68,68);font-family: Geneva , sans-serif;"><ul style="color: rgb(68,68,68);font-family: Geneva , sans-serif;"><li>And a very open-ended question to finish:</li><ul><li>Suppose there's a central database all these systems report back to. &nbsp;And they are all reporting all the time -- lots of asynchronous interleaved transactions. Only very occasionally the reports seem to get slightly mucked up when saving them in this central database. What possibilities are there for what's going wrong? How would you track them down?</li></ul></ul></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div><h2 style="font-family: Geneva , sans-serif;color: rgb(68,68,68);">Past Exam - 2005 Question 1</h2></div></div><div><br></div><div>UML and Design patterns.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
