# MATH1061

There's not much in here yet, because I didn't get around to writing electronic
resources when I was tutoring this course the first time around. But there is:

* Brief solutions to a previous midsemester practice exam, together with the
  practice questions.
* An overview of tutorials I've prepared
* Any electronic documents I've written to be used as tutorial material.
