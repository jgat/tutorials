## Week 2

* [Purity](http://xkcd.com/435/)
* Workbook pages 1-17 (Sections A.1 and A.2)
* Intro
  * Who I am
  * What happens in tutorials and why you should come
  * Asking the demographics of the class (what year level, what degree)
* Recap on last week's lectures:
  * Logical statements and connectives
  * Truth tables
  * Conditionals
* Practice in interpreting English statements.
* Assignment group discussion question.

## Week 3

* [Formal Logic](http://xkcd.com/1033/)
* Assignment 1 due on Friday, covers workbook chapters A and B. Reminder to
  submit to the box on level 4 and to check the marks website.
* Wolfram Alpha
* Workbook 18-44 (A.3 to B.3 and start of C.1)
* Recap last week's lectures with questions:
  * Valid and invalid arguments (find a way to make the implication false, maybe
    get a contradiction)
  * Digital logic -- given a system of logic gates, write the logical expression,
    and vice versa.
  * Quantifiers, incl. negation and multiple quantifiers. (Also, vacuous truth
    and vacuous falsehood) -- negation of "continuous on an interval"
* Individual questions on assignment

## Week 4

* [Three logicians walk into a bar](http://spikedmath.com/445.html)
* Point to the maths marks page, hand out assignments
* Assignment 1 discussion
* Assignment 2 tips
* Last week:
  * Definitions: even, odd, prime, composite, rational, irrational, divisibility,
  div/modulo/congruent, floor, ceiling
  * Proofs: Direct application of definitions, counterexample,
  division into cases.
* Exercises:
  * Explain the Spiked Math comic
  * Prove or disprove each of the following statements:
    * For all integers n > 5, 2^n-1 is composite.
    * Every integer is either even or odd (or both).
    * The sum of any two irrational numbers is irrational.
    * The sum of any two rational numbers is rational.
    * For all integers a, b, c, if a | c, then ab | c.
    <!-- * For all integers a, b, c, if ab | c, then a | c and a | b. -->
    * If a \equiv b and b \equiv c, then a \equiv c.

  * Graphs with loops, isolated vertices, parallel edges, simple graphs,
    digraphs, K\_n, bipartite graphs, K\_{mn}, subgraph, degree, total degree

  * Trees
* Exercise outlines:
  * Does a given degree sequence exist for graphs / simple graphs?
  * Does a graph / tree / connected graph exist with given vertex and edge counts?
  * Draw a graph with an Euler circuit and no Hamiltonian circuit
  * Draw a graph with a Hamiltonian circuit and no Euler circuit
* Exercises:
  1. Do the following graphs exist? (If so, give an example, if not, explain why)
     * A graph on 4 vertices with vertices of degree 1, 2, 3, 3.
     * A graph on 5 vertices with vertices of degree 1, 2, 3, 3, 5.
     * A simple graph on 6 vertices, all with degree 3.
     * A tree on 5 vertices with no leaves.
     * A connected graph with 8 vertices and 6 edges.
     * A connected graph with 10 vertices, 9 edges, and at least one cycle.
  2. A group of 4 men and 3 woman play a tennis tournament in the following way: two
     people (call them `A` and `B`) play a match, then `B` plays with someone
     else who is not `A` (call them `C`), then `C` plays with someone who is
     not `B`, then that person plays with someone who is not `C`, and so on.
     * The group would like to play in a way that everyone plays against
       everyone else exactly once. Is it possible to do this?
     * The group would like to play in a way that all the men play against each
       woman exactly once, and no two people of the same gender play against
       each other. Is it possible to do this?
     * The group would like to play in a way that everyone plays exactly twice,
       and they only play with someone of the opposite gender. Is it possible to
       do this?
