## Week 2

* [Purity](http://xkcd.com/435/)
* Workbook pages 1-17 (Sections A.1 and A.2)
* Intro
  * Who I am
  * What happens in tutorials and why you should come
  * Asking the demographics of the class (what year level, what degree)
* Recap on last week's lectures:
  * Logical statements and connectives
  * Truth tables
  * Conditionals
* Practice in interpreting English statements.
* Assignment group discussion question.

## Week 3

* [Formal Logic](http://xkcd.com/1033/)
* Assignment 1 due on Friday, covers workbook chapters A and B. Reminder to
  submit to the box on level 4 and to check the marks website.
* Wolfram Alpha
* Workbook 18-44 (A.3 to B.3 and start of C.1)
* Recap last week's lectures with questions:
  * Valid and invalid arguments (find a way to make the implication false, maybe
    get a contradiction)
  * Digital logic -- given a system of logic gates, write the logical expression,
    and vice versa.
  * Quantifiers, incl. negation and multiple quantifiers. (Also, vacuous truth
    and vacuous falsehood) -- negation of "continuous on an interval"
* Individual questions on assignment

## Week 4

* [Three logicians walk into a bar](http://spikedmath.com/445.html)
* Point to the maths marks page, hand out assignments
* Assignment 1 discussion
* Assignment 2 tips
* Last week:
  * Definitions: even, odd, prime, composite, rational, irrational, divisibility,
  div/modulo/congruent, floor, ceiling
  * Proofs: Direct application of definitions, counterexample,
  division into cases.
* Exercises:
  * Explain the Spiked Math comic
  * Prove or disprove each of the following statements:
    * For all integers n > 5, 2^n-1 is composite.
    * Every integer is either even or odd (or both).
    * The sum of any two irrational numbers is irrational.
    * The sum of any two rational numbers is rational.
    * For all integers a, b, c, if a | c, then ab | c.
    <!-- * For all integers a, b, c, if ab | c, then a | c and a | b. -->
    * If a \equiv b and b \equiv c, then a \equiv c.
