tutorials
=========

A collection of content that I've prepared for classroom tutorials I deliver at the University of Queensland.

Where I can, I'm including binaries for ease of use, and raw source for ease of modification (e.g. LaTeX documents
will generally have both the source `.tex` and generated `.pdf` files, as well as a makefile).

Available content includes materials that I generated myself, and some additional material which was already
publicly available during the offering of the course.

To request the addition of materials, or to point out a mistake,
[create an issue](https://github.com/jgat/tutorials/issues), or contact me directly.

## Courses

Tutorial material is made available from a subset of the course offerings I have tutored:

* [CSSE1001](http://uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=CSSE1001), Semesters (1 2011; 2 2011; 1 2012; 2 2012; 1 2013)
* [CSSE2003](http://uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=CSSE2003&offer=53544c554332494e&year=2012), Semester 2 2012
* [MATH1061](http://uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=MATH1061), Semesters (2 2012; 1 2013)
* [MATH1051](http://uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=MATH1051&offer=53544c554331494e&year=2012), Semester 1 2012
* [MATH1050](http://uq.edu.au/study/course.html?course_code=MATH1050&offer=53544c554332494e&year=2011), Semester 2 2011

Content from offerings listed above that don't appear here are either because I didn't generate any electronic
resources for teaching, I haven't bothered committing them yet, or the material is unsuitable for public access (e.g.
exercise solutions).
