tutorials
=========

A collection of content that I've prepared for classroom tutorials I deliver at the University of Queensland.

Where I can, I'm including binaries for ease of use, and raw source for ease of modification.

## Courses

Tutorial material is made available from a subset of the course offerings I have tutored:

* CSSE1001, Semesters (1 2011; 2 2011; 1 2012; 2 2012)
* CSSE2003, Semester 2 2012
* MATH1061, Semester 2 2012
* MATH1051, Semester 1 2012
* MATH1050, Semester 2 2011

Content from offerings listed above that don't appear here are either because I didn't generate any electronic
resources for teaching, I haven't bothered committing them yet, or the material is unsuitable for public access (e.g.
exercise solutions).
