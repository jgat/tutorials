# CSSE1001

Amongst the content I've prepared for this course is:

* Sample code and test cases to supplement tutorial material.
* Discussions and advice about course topics, and exam content.

I've also made significant contributions to the [course notes](http://itee.uq.edu.au/~csse1001/notes.html),
but I'm not publicly releasing the notes, since I'm not sure I can/should.
